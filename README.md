# RASPBERRY-PI-ULTRASONIC-DISTANCE-MEASUREMENT-ALARM-SYSTEM
 A Raspberry Pi-based system designed to detect the presence of objects in close proximity. The system utilizes an ultrasonic sensor to measure distance, generates alarms when objects are within a specified range, and includes functionality for distance tracking. The prototype seamlessly integrates four key components: an ultrasonic sensor for precise distance measurement, LED and buzzer modules as integral parts of the alarming system, and the Raspberry Pi Camera for real-time object visualization. The primary focus of this system is akin to modern-day car reverse alert systems.
